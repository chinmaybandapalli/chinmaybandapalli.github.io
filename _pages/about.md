Hello! Welcome to my ePortfolio. My name is Chinmay Bandapalli, now a second-year student at Georgia Tech pursuing a BS in Electrical Engineering. I am fondly interested in electronics devices and circuit technology, particularly semiconductor engineering. Experienced in digital design, PCB design, circuit analysis, and electronic lab skills, I am looking to break into the electronics industry through internship opportunites, extracurriculars, and technical projects. I thrive under team-focused environments, ready to learn new perspectives and improve my knowledge.

I always want to learn new things about my field and can't wait to take on new challenges. Don't hesitate to connect with me on any of my socials!
