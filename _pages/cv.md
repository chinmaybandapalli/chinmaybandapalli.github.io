Education
======
B.S. in Electrical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, May 2027
* GPA: 4.0

Relevant Coursework
======
* Digital Design: Design and implementation of digital systems on FPGAs; CAD tools (Quartus), project design methodologies, and digital logic synthesis; assembly language programming
* Circuit Analysis: Basic concepts of DC and AC circuit theory and analysis; first-order and second-order circuit analysis; sinusoidal steady state analysis and the phasor domain
* HW/SW Systems: Creation of complex execution and storage mechanisms; instruction set architecture and RISC-V; software design using the high-level programming language C; Programming design projects.

Work Experience
======
Flavin Neuromachines Laboratory | ECE Undergraduate Researcher | Altanta, GA | Dec 2024 – Present 	
* Haptic electronics research laboratory at Georgia Tech focused on patient care and biomedical applications.
* Training the BME 688/690 sensor using AI machine learning to consistently record and analyze accurate readings of individual gas compositions with a goal accuracy of at least 90%.
* Developing a platform for the BME 688/690 sensor using C and Altium, eventually integrating the sensor’s capabilities into wearable electronics for audiences sensitive to certain environmental factors (ex: VOCs).

Scintillating Bubble Chamber | Research Assistant | Batavia, IL | May – Aug 2023
* Physics based research laboratory at Northwestern focused on dark matter detection.
* Assembled multiple large coaxial cables from scratch using crimping tools and soldering for the functionality of an LED panel and vacuum chamber.
* Analyzed and tuned 8 onboard noise detectors using an oscilloscope (50% increase in sensitivity) to ensure proper noise detection.
* Repaired dozens of broken/loose sockets in the chamber’s ports and buses using crimping tools for proper electrical contact and functionality with its peripherals.

Extracurriculars
====
Marine Robotics Group | Electrical Team Member | Sept. 2024 – Present
* Constructed a functional electrical block schematic using KiCAD for the half-scale autonomous marine robot for the Microtransat competition. Currently prototyping on breadboards before manufacturing a permanent PCB.
* Designed a light tower system that relays information about the robot’s status/ failures that will later be programmed through firmware.
* Developing skills in PCB Design (KiCAD), power electronics, firmware development (ESP32), and electronic test equipment
