Education
======
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, May 2027

Relevant Coursework
======
* Digital Design: Design and implementation of digital systems on FPGAs; CAD tools (Quartus), project design methodologies, and digital logic synthesis; assembly language programming
* Circuit Analysis: Basic concepts of DC and AC circuit theory and analysis; first-order and second-order circuit analysis; sinusoidal steady state analysis and the phasor domain
* C/Assembly: Creation of complex execution and storage mechanisms; instruction set architecture and RISC-V; software design using the high-level programming language C; Programming design projects.


Work Experience
======
* Flavin Neuromachines Laboratory|ECE Undergraduate Researcher|Altanta, GA|Dec 2024 – Present 	
  * Haptic electronics research laboratory at Georgia Tech focused on patient care and biomedical applications.
  * Training the BME 688/690 sensor using AI machine learning to consistently record and analyze accurate readings of individual gas compositions with a goal accuracy of at least 90%.
  * Developing a platform for the BME 688/690 sensor using C and Altium, eventually integrating the sensor’s capabilities into wearable electronics for audiences sensitive to certain environmental factors (ex: VOCs).

* Scintillating Bubble Chamber|Research Assistant|Batavia, IL|May – Aug 2023
  * Physics based research laboratory at Northwestern focused on dark matter detection.
  * Assembled multiple large coaxial cables from scratch using crimping tools and soldering for the functionality of an LED panel and vacuum chamber.
  * Analyzed and tuned 8 onboard noise detectors using an oscilloscope (50% increase in sensitivity) to ensure proper noise detection.
  * Repaired dozens of broken/loose sockets in the chamber’s ports and buses using crimping tools for proper electrical contact and functionality with its peripherals.
