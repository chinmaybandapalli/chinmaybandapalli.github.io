Elevator Pitch
====
Electrical engineering major with strong electronics laboratory skills and hardware testing experience specializing in digital design and circuit analysis. Proficient with collaborating in fast-paced, team-based environments, troubleshooting and testing electrical work, and tackling circuit design tasks. Actively involved in research and development through multiple research lab experiences. Seeking an internship in the circuit technology field for Summer 2026.

Purpose
====
This website is meant to showcase what I already know/have done and what I still have to learn/pursue. My research experience, coursework, projects, extracurriculars, etc. display my skills in PCB design, digital design, circuit analysis, and general (electronic) laboratory work. This website also functions as a networking tool: not only to gain new connections, but provide existing connections with more information about me. Serving as a more in-depth compliation of my work, I hope this portfolio shows so much more than what a 1-page resume can. Hopefully visitors are able to see a determined electrical engineering student looking to explore the world of circuitry and electronics. 

This specific section highlights more of my personal background and the roots of my character/interests.

Background
====
I grew up in the Chicago suburban area in an Indian household. Even though my family, like many other Indian American families, instilled a priority of education, I also geniunely enjoyed learning and going to school to connect with friends and teachers. While I always claimed I was an introvert, I secretly loved talking, playing, and collaborating with people everyday. My passion for engineering loosely stemmed from building Legos and preferring math over english class, but it really took shape from loving computers. Fascinated with building computers at first, I became more interested with how computers functioned and how those tiny little chips and capacitors were actually made. Soon that interest broadened to electronics in general, but I never really acted upon it until recently. I would spend days dreaming of creating my own electronics, tearing apart old devices to look at its circuitry, but I would never have the spark to research, design, or create anything. In high school, the electricity & magnetism class along with the digital electronics class confirmed my love for electrical engineering, triumphing over the likes of mathematics and physics. I specifically joined clubs that involved computers and other electrical topics, such as our VEX robotics team and physics club. When searching for colleges, I priortized colleges that had strong hands-on engineering programs because I wanted to work with as much circuitry hardware as possible. I was fortunate enough to get accepted into Georgia Tech, a college I knew would help me explore circuits, electronics, and semiconductor engineering. 

Education
====
At Georgia Tech, I am pursing a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering with threads in [Circuit Technology](https://ece.gatech.edu/circuit-technology-thread) and [Electronic Devices](https://ece.gatech.edu/electronic-optoelectronic-devices-thread). The combination of these threads are exactly what I am looking to do in the future as both play into semiconductor devices, chip making, and circuit analysis. My projected graduation date is May 2027.

Some notable coursework I have done so far include: [Circuit Analysis](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2040), [Digital Design Laboratory](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2031), [Fundamentals of Digital Design Systems](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2020), [Programming for HW/SW Systems](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2035). These courses helped teach and reinforce my knowledge of digital design, programming, and circuit analysis. Some courses I look forward to taking in the near future include [Microelectronic Circuits](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece3040), [Microelectronics Laboratory](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece3043), [Semiconductor Devices](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece3450), and [IC Fabrication](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece4452), as they all relate to semiconductor engineering and circuit fabrication.
