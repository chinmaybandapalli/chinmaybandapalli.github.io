Purpose
====
This website is meant to showcase what I already know/have done and what I still have to learn/pursue. My research experience, coursework, projects, extracurriculars, etc. display my skills in PCB design, digital design, circuit analysis, and general (electronic) laboratory work. This website also functions as a networking tool: not only to gain new connections, but provide existing connections with more information about me. Serving as a more in-depth compliation of my work, I hope this portfolio shows so much more than what a 1-page resume can. Hopefully visitors are able to see a determined electrical engineering student looking to explore the world of circuitry and electronics. 

This specific section highlights more of my personal background and the roots of my character/interests.

Background
====
I grew up in the Chicago suburbs in an Indian household. Even though my family, like many other Indian American families, instilled a priority of education, I also geniunely enjoyed learning and going to school to connect with friends and teachers. While I always claimed I was an introvert, I secretly loved talking, playing, and collaborating with people everyday. Along with education, my family taught me the power of respect, hard-work, and decision making. Growing up, I of course looked up to (and still do) my older brother. Through my life, he has guided me through challenges, but more importantly, has been a great best friend. I attribute who I am today to my family, and I am forever grateful for their support as I navigate through the next stage of life as a scholar of electrical engineering. 

My passion for engineering loosely stemmed from building Legos and preferring math over english class, but it really took shape from loving computers. Fascinated with building computers at first, I became more interested with how computers functioned and how those tiny little chips and capacitors were actually made. Soon that interest broadened to electronics in general. In high school, the electricity & magnetism class along with the digital electronics class confirmed my love for electrical engineering, triumphing over the likes of mathematics and physics. I specifically joined clubs that involved computers and other electrical topics, such as our VEX robotics team and physics club. 

When searching for colleges, I priortized colleges that had strong hands-on engineering programs because I wanted to work with as much circuitry hardware as possible. I was fortunate enough to get accepted into Georgia Tech, a college I knew would help me explore circuits, electronics, and semiconductor engineering. 

Outside of academics, I still enjoy keeping up with computer hardware, both new and vintage. I am also big on building keyboards, and I have made at least a dozen for peers in the past 5 years. My other hobbies include watching and playing basketball and cooking (still a novice!). 


Education
====
At Georgia Tech, I am pursing a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering with threads in [Circuit Technology](https://ece.gatech.edu/circuit-technology-thread) and [Electronic Devices](https://ece.gatech.edu/electronic-optoelectronic-devices-thread). The combination of these threads are exactly what I am looking to do in the future as both play into semiconductor devices, chip making, and circuit analysis. My projected graduation date is May 2027.

Some notable coursework I have done so far include: [Circuit Analysis](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2040), [Digital Design Laboratory](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2031), [Fundamentals of Digital Design Systems](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2020), [Programming for HW/SW Systems](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2035). These courses helped teach and reinforce my knowledge of digital design, programming, and circuit analysis. Some courses I look forward to taking in the near future include [Microelectronic Circuits](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece3040), [Microelectronics Laboratory](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece3043), [Semiconductor Devices](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece3450), and [IC Fabrication](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece4452), as they all relate to semiconductor engineering and circuit fabrication.

Along with coursework, I joined the [Marine Robotics Group](https://www.gt-mrg.org/about), specifically working on the Microtransat project. As an electrical team member, I am growing my skills in PCB design using KiCAD as I work to design the boat's main PCB.

Research Experience
====
I have worked under a few research labs at both Northwestern and Georgia Tech. In the summer of 2022, I worked with Professor Eric Dahl on his scintillating bubble chamber at Fermilab. The purpose of the bubble chamber was to detect dark matter particles using liquid argon. I specifically worked on the wiring and wire fabrication of the machine, gaining skills in crimping, soldering, and general electrical troubleshooting. I also had to test the quality of the hundreds of sensors (temperature, noise) on the chamber using a multimeter and oscilloscope. For more information, click [here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12400)

In Spring 2025, I joined the [Flavin Neuromachines Laboratory](https://flavinlab.io/) at Georgia Tech. Led by Professor Matthew Flavin, the group focuses on wearable haptic devices mainly applicable to patient care. Currently, I am working on a project that involves the BME 688 environmental sensor. The sensor can measure temperature, pressure, humidity, and VOCs in the air using artificial intelligence. We are currently looking at ways to integrate the sensor into wearable haptics. Through this project, I am learning how to use microcontroller platforms (Arduino, ESP32, and nRF), programming languagues (C/C++), and ECAD programs (Altium and KiCAD). 

For Summer 2025, I am working at Northwestern under Professor John Rogers in his [Rogers Research Group](https://rogersgroup.northwestern.edu/), where I will be working with a broader range of bioelectronics and wearable haptic devices. At the moment, I am working on the data analysis/graph plotting of finished clinical trials with patients of compromised foot function. More on this soon!

Skills
====
Through my courses, clubs, research, and projects, I have been developing and acquiring skills related to electrical engineering, but also some soft skills that may be valuable in the industry. I hope to build off these technical and soft skills to eventually prepare myself for the semiconductor industry.

Programming
----
I am familiar with Python and Java. I have worked with Python to construct basic programs, conduct data analysis in research groups, and code robot autonomy in my VEX robotics group. I regularly work with C in the Flavin group to code our sensors, and I have taken a course that goes in-depth about how C functions [Programming for HW/SW Systems](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2035). I have also used C in several projects such as a snake game and a puzzle solver, learning how to construct efficient solutions to a coding problem. Other languages I have worked with are RISC-V (from the same course), VHDL, and Julia. I am currently learning how to use Julia in the Rogers Group to conduct pressure map plotting. 

Hardware
----
I have experience with microcontroller programming through using Arduino and ESP32 in the Flavin group and the Marine Robotics Group. I have programmed FPGAs in [Digital Design Laboratory](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2031) on the DE-10 Standard to run a simple computer and several state machine exercises. Through my lab experience at Northwestern and Georgia Tech, I became familiar with electronic test bench equipment such oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and mulitmeters for electrical troubleshooting. In all my electrical engineering related experiences, I have honed my soldering skills to create wires, attach components, etc. 

Software
----
I am currently learning how to use various ECAD programs such as KiCAD and Altium to design PCBs. Specifically, I am working on designing a keyboard PCB using KiCAD, and I hope to be able to use KiCAD proficiently by the end of the project to utilize in MRG and the Flavin Group. I have used Altera Quartus Prime in Digital Design Lab to code the DE-10 standard, where we learned how to make block schematics and VHDL to make digital design systems (simple computer, state machine light system). In terms of simulation, I have used NI Multisim to simulate various counters and HEX display systems. I wish to learn a SPICE program such as LTSpice to match an industry requirement for interns to know SPICE. 

Communication
----
I am quite experienced in team environments, as almost all of my experiences in both college and high school has involved team building, collaboration, and prototying in a group in order to succeed. I am also familiar with working under pressure as we constantly have to juggle deadlines in competition clubs like MRG. I know what it is like to work with people: sharing ideas, providing criticism and potential solutions, and being open to different perspectives. Design proposals, technical/lab reports, presentation skills were all developed through classes here at Georgia Tech, especially in Digital Design Lab. Our final project in that class involved a design proposal presentation, several lab reports on our progress and results, and live demonstration of our product (which was an LED peripheral for the DE-10).
