Electrical engineering major with strong electronics laboratory skills and hardware testing experience specializing in digital design and circuit analysis. Proficient with collaborating in fast-paced, team-based environments, troubleshooting and testing electrical work, and tackling circuit design tasks. Actively involved in research and development through multiple research lab experiences. Seeking an internship in the circuit technology field for Summer 2026.

Purpose
====
This website is meant to showcase what I already know/have done and what I still have to learn/pursue. My research experience, coursework, projects, extracurriculars, etc. display my skills in PCB design, digital design, circuit analysis, and general (electronic) laboratory work. This website also functions as a networking tool: not only to gain new connections, but provide existing connections with more information about me. Serving as a more in-depth compliation of my work, I hope this portfolio shows so much more than what a 1-page resume can. Hopefully visitors are able to see a determined electrical engineering student looking to explore the world of circuitry and electronics. 

This specific section highlights more of my personal background and the roots of my character/interests.

Background
====
I grew up in the Chicago suburbs in an Indian household. Even though my family, like many other Indian American families, instilled a priority of education, I also geniunely enjoyed learning and going to school to connect with friends and teachers. While I always claimed I was an introvert, I secretly loved talking, playing, and collaborating with people everyday. Along with education, my family taught me the power of respect, hard-work, and decision making. Growing up, I of course looked up to (and still do) my older brother. Through my life, he has guided me through challenges, but more importantly, has been a great best friend. I attribute who I am today to my family, and I am forever grateful for their support as I navigate through the next stage of life as a scholar of electrical engineering. 

My passion for engineering loosely stemmed from building Legos and preferring math over english class, but it really took shape from loving computers. Fascinated with building computers at first, I became more interested with how computers functioned and how those tiny little chips and capacitors were actually made. Soon that interest broadened to electronics in general. In high school, the electricity & magnetism class along with the digital electronics class confirmed my love for electrical engineering, triumphing over the likes of mathematics and physics. I specifically joined clubs that involved computers and other electrical topics, such as our VEX robotics team and physics club. 

When searching for colleges, I priortized colleges that had strong hands-on engineering programs because I wanted to work with as much circuitry hardware as possible. I was fortunate enough to get accepted into Georgia Tech, a college I knew would help me explore circuits, electronics, and semiconductor engineering. 

Outside of academics, I still enjoy keeping up with computer hardware, both new and vintage. I am also big on building keyboards, and I have made at least a dozen for peers in the past 5 years. My other hobbies include watching and playing basketball and cooking (still a novice!). 


Education
====
At Georgia Tech, I am pursing a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering with threads in [Circuit Technology](https://ece.gatech.edu/circuit-technology-thread) and [Electronic Devices](https://ece.gatech.edu/electronic-optoelectronic-devices-thread). The combination of these threads are exactly what I am looking to do in the future as both play into semiconductor devices, chip making, and circuit analysis. My projected graduation date is May 2027.

Some notable coursework I have done so far include: [Circuit Analysis](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2040), [Digital Design Laboratory](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2031), [Fundamentals of Digital Design Systems](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2020), [Programming for HW/SW Systems](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece2035). These courses helped teach and reinforce my knowledge of digital design, programming, and circuit analysis. Some courses I look forward to taking in the near future include [Microelectronic Circuits](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece3040), [Microelectronics Laboratory](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece3043), [Semiconductor Devices](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece3450), and [IC Fabrication](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece4452), as they all relate to semiconductor engineering and circuit fabrication.

Along with coursework, I joined the [Marine Robotics Group](https://marinerobotics.gtorg.gatech.edu/), specifically working on the Microtransat project. As an electrical team member, I am growing my skills in PCB design using KiCAD as I work to design the boat's main PCB. 

Here is a quick introduction to the Microtransat project we are doing: <https://youtu.be/F39G02bMFhE?si=OtCjlG09Ebsj5nz9>

Research Experience
====
I have worked under a few research labs at both Northwestern and Georgia Tech. In the summer of 2022, I worked with Professor Eric Dahl on his scintillating bubble chamber at Fermilab. The purpose of the bubble chamber was to detect dark matter particles using liquid argon. I specifically worked on the wiring and wire fabrication of the machine, gaining skills in crimping, soldering, and general electrical troubleshooting. I also had to test the quality of the hundreds of sensors (temperature, noise) on the chamber using a multimeter and oscilloscope. For more information, click [here.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12400)

In Spring 2025, I joined the [Flavin Neuromachines Laboratory](https://flavinlab.io/) at Georgia Tech. Led by Professor Matthew Flavin, the group focuses on wearable haptic devices mainly applicable to patient care. Currently, I am working on a project that involves the BME 688 environmental sensor. The sensor can measure temperature, pressure, humidity, and VOCs in the air using artificial intelligence. We are currently looking at ways to integrate the sensor into wearable haptics. Through this project, I am learning how to use microcontroller platforms (Arduino, ESP32, and nRF), programming languagues (C/C++), and ECAD programs (Altium and KiCAD). ![flavin]

For Summer 2025, I am working at Northwestern under Professor John Rogers in his [Rogers Research Group](https://rogersgroup.northwestern.edu/), where I will be working with a broader range of bioelectronics and wearable haptic devices. At the moment, I am working on the data analysis/graph plotting of finished clinical trials with patients of compromised foot function. More on this soon!
