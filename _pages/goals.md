Timeline

Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering (Present - May 2027/2028)
----
I expect to graduate around May 2027, but if needed, I can take another year for a 4 year degree. In the next 2-3 years, I hope to complete all my required courses for my degree, and graduate with some sort of honors. During these years, I hope to apply to the BS/MS program at Georgia Tech for a seamless transistion into my master's degree. Throughout my bachelor's, I want to supplement my academics with internships and research to keep in touch with the latest trends in the industry while also gaining relevant skills.

Master's Degree in Electrical Engineering (Aug 2027/2028 - May 2028/2029)
----
Through the BS/MS program at Georgia Tech, I will get a headstart on my master's degree, as it is in high demand for the semiconductor industry. By 2028/2029, I hope to graduate with a master's degree. Before graduation, I will look out for semiconductor related jobs to ensure I have something planned after graduation. Like with my bachelor's, I will pursue semiconductor specific internships and research opportunties to make myself more competitive for the job market. 

Junior Electrical Engineer Role (Post Graduation) 
----
Due to the increasing competitiveness of the job market, it may be difficult to find a job right after graduation, especially one related to the semiconductor field. I hope to find a job within a year after graduation. If there is downtime between graduation and my first job, I will continue to grow my skills in any way I could to prepare for a more fitting role. Even if the role is not directly related to semiconductors, an electrical engineer role would be useful to build experience in the industry. I can learn other skills in other branches such as power or RF. Ideally, I would want a job where I would gain hands-on experience working with hardware (Test or Fabrication), but any role with applicable skills to other roles will be valuable. 

Semiconductor Engineer Role (5+ Years Post Graduation)
----
Eventually, I hope to finally land a role at a semiconductor company within 5-7 years post graduation. While it may be difficult to find work in fabrication, working with semiconductors in general adds tremendous value to my career. I would like to stick with companies such as/similar to Texas Instruments, Micron, TSMC, Samsung, etc. where I would be exposed to work directly adjacent to my work in college/past jobs. 

Next Steps
====
Gain experience with semiconductor engineering and analog/digital circuit design
----
Since I aspire to create semiconductor devices in the future, I want to have the skills needed to thrive in the industry. Luckily, there are plenty of opportunites at Georgia Tech and other extracurriculars to help me towards my goal. For courses, I hope that [Semiconductor Devices](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece3450) and [IC Fabrication](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece4452) can build the foundation for understanding semiconductor devices, while [Analog Integrated Circuits](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece4430) and [Digital Integrated Circuits](https://ece.gatech.edu/courses/ece4420) can improve my skills with the digital and analog world. These classes also promise hands-on experience with design an fabrication of integrated circuits and wafers. As for clubs, I can look into [SiliconJackets](https://siliconjackets.gt/), a group that works with semiconductor design and tapeout. They also have valuable connections with the industry that I could possibly take advantage of. Research labs will also be useful to gain the necessary knowledge and skills to remain competitive. I could continue my work with the Flavin group as I will eventually do circuit design, or pursue semiconductor adjacent groups here at Georgia Tech. I will actively to pursue summer internships, targetting roles that relate to circuit/PCB design, test, and semiconductor roles from companies such as or similar to Texas Instruments, Micron, and Infineon.
